1. It is a blueprint to create Objects

2. Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its methods

3. Every class in Java can be composed of the following elements:
    i. fields, member variables or instance variables - These are variables that hold data specific to a particular object. For each object of a class, there is one field.
    ii. member methods or instance methods - These perform operations on objects and are defined within the class.
    iii. static or class fields - These fields are common to any object within the same class. They can only exist once in the class irrespective of the total number of objects in the class.
    iv. static or class methods - These methods do not affect a specific object in the class.
    v. inner classes - At times a class will be defined within a class if it is a subset of another class. The class contained within another is the inner class.

            4. Object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class.
            5. All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects
5. Objects are allocated memory space whenever they are created but No memory is allocated when a class is created.
            6. An object can call the methods defined in the class to perform specific tasks.


    Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology to design a program using classes and objects.
    Objects are the main building blocks of OOPS i.e your applications will be divided into multiple objects.
            A class with
 Data members
         Methods -
    OOPs concepts -
    o Abstraction
    o Encapsulation
    o Inheritance
    o Polymorphism
