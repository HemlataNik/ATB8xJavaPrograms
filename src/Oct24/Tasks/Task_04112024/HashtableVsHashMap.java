    #What is a Hashtable in Java, and how does it differ from HashMap?

A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs.
It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.
Ref

// Hashtable is synchronized, HashMap is not
Hashtable<Integer, String> hashtable = new Hashtable<>();
HashMap<Integer, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

Internal working of a Hashtable.

Hashtable stores key-value pairs in an array of buckets.
Each bucket contains a linked list of entries to handle collisions.
