    //Problem with Arrays
    /*
       -Since we have to give size, memory is wasted.
       - Insertion and deletion are heavy.
       - No built in support for sorting and searching.

        We prefer legacy classes and legacy Interfaces in place of Arrays

        Legacy Classes: 1. Vector
        2. Stack
        3. Properties
        4. Hash
        5. Dictionary

        Legacy Interfaces:
        Enumeration(cursor): It is an interface used to get elements of legacy collections(Vector, Hashtable)

What is Collection?
        -- Collecton Framework defined in JDK1.2 which holds all the collection classes and interfaces.
        --Collection Interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface(java.util.Map) are the two main root interfaces of Java collection classes.

    Advantages
    - Reducing programming effort
    - Increases program speed and quality
    - consistent API - add(), remove(), contains()
